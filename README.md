## Installing

This widget relies on static files, which must be installed manually.
Simply copy the directory thermoKnob into the static html area of openhab.

For openraspbian, just do

`cp -r thermoKnob /etc/openhab2/html/`

If you install the file elsewhere, make sure you adjust the widget [thermo-knob.widget.json](thermo-knob.widget.json) file accordingly.
